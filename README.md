## How to add or change item descriptions

First, create yourself a Github account and verify the Email address.


### Adding a new item description

1. Grab the id of the item you want to add. Therefore visit the item's wiki page and take the small text under the items name, starting with bk: - this is the item's id.

2. Open this link https://github.com/RexcellentGames/BkWikiData/tree/master/data/items

3. See if the item you want to add already has a description file in that folder. If it has, scroll down a bit and see the **Editing an item's description** section below. Please note that the semicolon in the id gets switched out for a _ here. So *bk:itemname* becomes *bk_itemname*.

4. Click on "Create new file"

5. Name it bk_**itemidhere**.md - Example: An item with the id *bk:itemname* needs it's file to be this name:

6. Add the description. That's pretty straight forward.

Tip: You can also preview your changes to get a rough idea of how they will look in the wiki. Click on "Preview" in order to do that.

7. When you're done, scroll down a bit. Under "Propose new file", change the first text field to "Add description for [your item id here]". You can leave the second one empty.

8. Click on the bold green button.

9. Then, don't change anything and just continue by clicking on "Create pull request".

10. Again, change nothing and click "Create pull request" one last time.

Your suggestion is now submitted and if it is good enough, one of the wiki admins will publish your changes on the official Burning Knight Wiki.


### Editing an item's description

1. Find the item's description file. If you don't know how to find the item id, please read the chapter above. Once you found the file, click it!
